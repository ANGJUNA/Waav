1. Introduction to Waav
====================

**Waav** company uses multiple vendor SIM cards like our NTC, NCELL.

*Billing* is all about how much data a particular router is using a ``router`` is identified by ROID or Serial number unique to the WAAV system.
A ``router``can belong to multiple companies. Currently billing is handled like when the router is ordered to router vender after loading the WAAV os and once all tests are done, they are shipped to client deployment - eg:. to a school bus.

Until that router is shipped [From vender say Intel to waav warehouse], 
This belongs to WAAV company. [In production this company name can be different].
