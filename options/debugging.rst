6. Debugging
===========
Both waavadmin and clipbucket are being executed through php via a common container (web_php) running in PHP 5.6. So with this structure setup, upgrading only one for PHP version will need additional split up and possibly fixes on inter-container communication scripts.

6.1 Docker Container (Alpine) Kernel/User Logs
+++++++++++++++++++++++++
    * docker logs web_php -f [to fetch all running container logs by querying to docker daemon, or container specific]
    * docker-compose -f docker-ingress.yml logs -n 1000 -f [fetching through docker compose service, querying by file name or container name]

6.2 Logs Generated By Application
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

#. Waavadmin
.. note::
    * /var/www/controlroom/storage/logs/laravel.log by Laravel Framework
    * Custom logger to detect all Post and GET requests to debug API requests and workload [Strictly advised to turn off in production and turn on only under active observation mode due to excessive logging and possibility of disk filling up]
    * TODO: HOW TO TURN IT ON/OFF

#. Control Room
.. note::
    * Clipbucket has very poor error log handling [We are having a discussion to make robust logging]
    * Custom logging by exception handling or querying to nginx and php containers [no log file defined or somehow got removed, we can simply add a error log, in TO-DO list]
